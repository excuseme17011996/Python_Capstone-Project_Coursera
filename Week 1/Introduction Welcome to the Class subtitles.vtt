Hello and welcome to the Capstone.

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.610
At this point, we've been together for
four classes, so I thank you for

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.170
your dedication and the amount of time
that you've put in to get this far.

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.486
This is supposed to be fun,

5
00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:21.303
Capstone is not supposed to
contain any new information.

6
00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:24.172
It's really just supposed to
apply the things that we've done.

7
00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:28.231
But one of the things that I want to
do in this Capstone is give you

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:33.950
an opportunity to talk and even lead and
be creative and come up with ideas.

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.110
And to accomplish that,
we've got three required assignments.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.890
And if all you want to do is
the three required assignments,

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
you download some code, you run some
stuff, you do some screen shots,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.080
we peer grade them and you're done.

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.030
That's if you really just
kind of want to get in and

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.230
get out,
just do the three required assignments.

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.610
But in order to get you talking,
we have three optional assignments.

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.503
And the optional assignments are where you
build on what we're doing in this capstone

17
00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:02.355
and you choose a data source of your own.

18
00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:06.018
And you do some data analysis and
maybe some data retrieval and

19
00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:09.690
then maybe some data visualization and
then we talk about it.

20
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.110
You can put up some YouTube video or
you can upload a file somewhere.

21
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.280
And then we'll have you build
a threaded discussion so

22
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.055
that you can talk about it and
other students can talk about it as well.

23
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:24.115
And literally,
in these three optional assignments,

24
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.575
you might decide that
people will group together.

25
00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.569
And someone will present an idea and
someone else will want to work on it and

26
00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:30.210
that's okay.

27
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.005
The other thing that is totally
okay is putting code in the forums.

28
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.767
That's been verboten so far in this class,
but it's not verboten anymore.

29
00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.393
We're not going to filter the forums,
we're not going to tell you you can't

30
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:45.436
write code because at some point if you're
working together using this forums,

31
00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:47.517
then you might have to
put code up like hi,

32
00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:50.812
I didn't get this working or
why is this not going on or whatever.

33
00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:54.370
And so that's okay,
we're going to loosen things up a bit.

34
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.670
So I'm really in a way looking forward
to seeing what you're going to do,

35
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.860
what you're going to accomplish in
these courses, in this capstone,

36
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.125
again the optional stuff.

37
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:06.535
So I'm looking forward to that because
I've been coming up with the ideas but

38
00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:10.405
I think you're going to come up with
a lot of wonderful things.and so

39
00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:14.145
I really am looking forward to
the Capstone and welcome to the course and

40
00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:14.805
see you on the net.
